# Denperidge's scripts

Some scripts that I have written!

## Scripts:

### Image sorting
#### [date-recursive.py](date-recursive.py)
Recursively rename your images based on metadata!

*Requirements:* Python3, exiftool

#### [DELduplicates.py](DELduplicates.py)
I forgot what I used this for but it was in the folder where MOVe.py was!

*Requirements:* Python3

#### [MOVe.py](MOVe.py)
(i)Phones now often take pictures in .JPG/.PNG as well as .MOV. So now I use Photosift to sort the images, and then run MOVe.py to move the .MOV's towards them!

*Requirements:* Python3


### Development
#### [gh-card-png.sh](gh-card-png.sh)
Leverages the gh-card project to create PNG repo cards. Because Google Docs doesn't support SVG's.

*Requirements:* wget, inkscape


## Discussions
### Why a repo?
Originally I had some of these as gists. But I've noticed updating it there isn't really super efficienct, and it felt super disorganised. Now I can use shortcuts or symlinks towards a central place on my computer, and I can move it between devices. Gists kinda seem to work best with snippets of code mostly!
