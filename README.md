### Why a repo?
Originally I had some of these as gists. But I've noticed updating it there isn't really super efficienct, and it felt super disorganised. Now I can use shortcuts or symlinks towards a central place on my computer, and I can move it between devices. Gists kinda seem to work best with snippets of code mostly!
