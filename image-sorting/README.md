# Image sorting
## [date-recursive.py](date-recursive.py)
Recursively rename your images based on metadata!

*Requirements:* Python3, exiftool

## [DELduplicates.py](DELduplicates.py)
I forgot what I used this for but it was in the folder where MOVe.py was!

*Requirements:* Python3

## [MOVe.py](MOVe.py)
(i)Phones now often take pictures in .JPG/.PNG as well as .MOV. So now I use Photosift to sort the images, and then run MOVe.py to move the .MOV's towards them!

*Requirements:* Python3
